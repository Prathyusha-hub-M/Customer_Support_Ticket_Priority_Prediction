### Customer Support Ticket Priority Prediction

This project predicts the priority of customer support tickets using machine learning.

The goal is to automatically classify incoming tickets into priority levels so that urgent issues are handled faster.

### Problem Statement

Customer support teams receive a large number of tickets every day.

Manually identifying high priority and critical issues is slow and error prone.

This project builds an end to end machine learning pipeline to automatically predict ticket priority based on ticket metadata and text content.

### Dataset

The dataset contains customer support tickets with the following information:

- Queue or department
- Ticket subject
- Ticket body
- Ticket type
- Priority label

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with critical tickets being rare but very important
